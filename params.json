The gyroscope and accelerometer readings are performed every 2ms filtering only the accelerometer, for later each 6ms accelerometer measures through a complementary type Kalman filter. Finally gets a filtered measure each 12ms moment in which the predictive adaptive function is called. All filters in the MPU6050 have been disabled by enabling a high speed of response.\r\n\r\nIn this robot is controled roll and yaw position, therefore, it is always in balancing mode and is always in the same direction.\r\n\r\nWe can see how even the predictive adaptive control adapts to noise getting a satisfactory control of the process.
